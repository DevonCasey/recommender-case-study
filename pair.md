## Movie Recommendations

Go do awesome at [this](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/movie-recommendation) data modeling competition.

More instructions are on that web page. To get started, build off the code you wrote yesterday and/or the code available on the competition page.

The leaderboard will not be updated automatically when you make your submission, but you will receive a score.  Write your best score on the whiteboard, and we will have our own in-class competition.
